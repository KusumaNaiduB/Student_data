Objective:
The objective is to create a program in C# that retrieves student data from a text file and displays it within a Visual Studio Windows Console Project.

Tools Used:
Visual Studio: Utilized for creating a Windows Console Project in C#.
Text Editor (e.g., Notepad): Used to create and edit the text file containing student data.
Git & GitHub: Employed for version control and repository hosting.

Step-by-Step Process:
1. Setting Up the Visual Studio Project:
Creation of Project: Opened Visual Studio and initiated a new Windows Console Project in C#.
Project Structure: Developed a structured layout for the project, including folders for source code and documentation.
2. Text File Creation and Structure:
Text File Format: Created a text file externally using a text editor such as Notepad.
Data Format: Structured the data in a delimited format suitable for student information.
Data:
StudentID,Name,Grade
1, kusuma, 12
2, Haritha, 10
3, pooja, 11
...

3. Coding the Program:
Reading Text File: Implemented C# code to read the text file containing student data.
Parsing Data: Split each line by delimiters to extract and display StudentID, Name, and Grade.
Error Handling: Included error handling to manage exceptions during file reading or data processing.
4. Git Repository Setup:
Initialization: Initialized a Git repository within the project directory.
Ignored Files: Specified files/folders (e.g., build outputs, temporary files) to be excluded using a .gitignore file.
Tracking Code: Commits were made to track changes and maintain version history.
5. Documentation:
Code Comments: Included comments within the code to explain logic, functionality, and key sections.
Readme File: Created a readme file documenting steps to execute the program, details about the text file's structure, and any other pertinent information.
6. Testing and Validation:
Functionality Testing: Conducted thorough testing to ensure accurate retrieval and display of student data.
Data Accuracy: Verified that the displayed data matched the content of the text file accurately.
Handling Exceptions: Ensured the program gracefully handled unexpected errors during execution.
7. Repository Submission:
GitHub Repository: Pushed the code to a GitHub repository.
Sharing Link: Submitted the GitHub repository link along with comprehensive documentation as per the task requirements.
Conclusion:
This program fulfills the task requirements by effectively retrieving student data from a text file and displaying it in a console application. It adheres to best practices, utilizes version control, and includes detailed documentation to facilitate its understanding and usage.
